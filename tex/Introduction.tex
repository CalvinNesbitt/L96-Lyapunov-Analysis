\section{Introduction}

The first thing we have done is implemented the Ginelli algorithm \cite{Ginelli2013} for finding the Lyapunov exponents (LEs), backward Lyapunov vectors (BLVs) and covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) \cite{Kuptsov2012} for the Lorenz $96$ system. The methodology for this is outlined in \ref{section: Ginelli-Alg}\\

This has been built on by changing the strength of coupling between the fast and slow variable in the Lorenz $96$ model and observing the effect on the exponents and vectors. This is largely inspired by \cite{Carlu2019}. \\

Finally, following \cite{Politi2014}, we have examined how the finite time Lyapunov exponents fluctuate within the attractor. In particular, we have attempted to obtain a large deviation result numerically. This is discussed in sections \ref{section: FTLE-Fluctuations} and \ref{section: Rate-Convergence}.
