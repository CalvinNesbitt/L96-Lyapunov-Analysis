\subsection{Large Deviation Principles}

Next we seek a large deviation principle for the FTLEs. In figure \ref{fig: Rate-Convergence} we have plotted a numerical estimate of the FTLE rate functions for increasing lengths of time $\tau$ (see section \ref{section: FTLE-Fluctuations}). Across the figure we plot rate functions for different indices of the Lyapunov exponents whilst down the figure we change the value of $c$. We find that the convergence speed is faster for near $0$ FTLEs whilst for both large stable and unstable FTLEs it is slow.\\

Averaging time is given in units of integrated autocorrelation. Across the figure we plot rate functions for different indices of the Lyapunov exponents whilst down the figure we change the value of $c$.}

In figure \ref{fig: Rate-C-v-B} we have plotted a comparison of the FTCLE and FTBLE numerical rate functions. The time over which the FTLEs represent the growth rate is $100 \tau$. Across the figure we plot rate functions for different indices of the Lyapunov exponents whilst down the figure we change the value of $c$. We find that both the FTBLE and FTCLE rate functions agree.\\

% Finally in figure \ref{fig: ks-entropy-c-effect} we see the effect of $c$ on the KS entropy rate function.
