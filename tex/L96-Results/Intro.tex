\section{Lyapunov Analysis of the Two Scale Lorenz $96$ Model}

In this section we will analyse the effect of the time scale seperation parameter $c$ and the coupling strenght parameter $h$ on the Lyapunov exponents and vectors. In particular, beyond a general discussion of the effect of the aforementioned parameters on the mean values of FTLEs and their variance, three further questions we will seek to address are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is it possible to associate large/small scale variables with particular CLVs? This is inspired by the findings \cite{Vannitsem2016}.
    \item Can we obtain large deviation principles for the FTLEs? If so, are the rate functions for the FTCLEs and FTBLEs the same? This question is inspired by the work in \cite{Vannitsem2016} and \cite{DeCruz2018}.
    \item To what extent are the stable, unstable and centre manifolds distinguishable from one another? This will help us address the question of whether the Lorenz $96$ can be modelled as hyperbolic or not. This largely builds on \cite{Carlu2019}.
\end{enumerate}

Of course we are also interested in how both $c$ and $h$ effect the answer to these questions.\\

In section \ref{section: L96-Model} we will introduce the two scale Lorenz $96$ model.\\

In section \ref{section:c-effect} we will discuss our findings upon varying the time scale seperation parameter $c$.
