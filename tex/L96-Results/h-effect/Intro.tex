\subsection{Effect of the Coupling Strength} \label{section:h-effect}

We have also investigated the effect of coupling strength on the FTLEs and LVs. Specifically, for five evenly spaced values of $h$ between $\frac{1}{16}$ and $1$ we have calculated the backward Lyapunov vectors (BLVs), covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVS) and Lyapunov exponents (LEs) for the parameters outlined in table \ref{Model-Parameter-Table} and \ref{Integration-Parameter-Table} with $c=10$.
