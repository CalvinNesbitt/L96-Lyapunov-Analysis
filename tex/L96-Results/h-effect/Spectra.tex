\subsection{FTLE Means and Variance}

We have calculated the Lyapunov spectra by calculating the growth rate of both the CLVs and BLVs. In fig \ref{fig:h-effect-CLE} we plot the Lyapunov exponents from the FTCLE calculation whilst the absolute and relative disagreements between the two calculations are plotted in figures \ref{fig:h-Abs-Disagree} and \ref{fig:h-Rel-Disagree}. As one would expect, the two spectra agree although there is some discrepancy for the near $0$ exponents. Note that a larger value of $c$ corresponds to less near $0$ exponents as well as an increase in the absolute value of the most positive and negative exponents.\\

In figure \ref{fig:h-Variance} we have plotted the effect of $c$ on the variance of the FTCLEs. We find that the variance increases with $c$. Note there is also a distinguishable `valley' in the variance between roughly indices $200$ and $250$. We note that this valley is distinguishable for all values of $c$.

In figure \ref{fig:h-variance-c-vs-b} we have plotted a comparison of the FTCLE and FTBLE variance for $c = 15$. As expected (see section $5.1$ of \cite{Pikovsky2016}) we find the FTCLE variance is higher than that of the FTBLEs due to fluctuation of the determinant of the CLV matrix. We have verified this is the case for all values of $c$
